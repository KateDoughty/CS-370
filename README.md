## Briefly explain the work that you did on this project: What code were you given? What code did you create yourself?
For this project, we were given a shell code and tasked with completing the machine learning for an agent. To complete the code, I wrote the game loops that utilize Keras and TensorFlow to achieve the pathfinding solution.
## Connect your learning from throughout this course to the larger field of computer science:
### What do computer scientists do and why does it matter?
Computer scientists utilize technology to creatively solve complex problems, developing programs that enrich the lives of others.
### How do I approach a problem as a computer scientist?
The best way to approach problems as a computer scientist is with a technical mindset and efficient use of resources.
### What are my ethical responsibilities to the end user and the organization?
During this course, I learned about a crucial ethical issue concerning hidden biases in AI. Any AI system can be prone to biases, which can harm our society without our knowledge. As a machine learning developer, it is crucial for me to acknowledge my own biases and strive to design unbiased systems.
